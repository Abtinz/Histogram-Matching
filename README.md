# Histogram-Matching
Linear algebra final project

Histogram-Matching:

In this program, first we display a reference photo and a basic photo, and then we divide the reference photo into three red, blue, and green channels, and by finding the maximum number of pixels for rgb for each channel and uses the rate that our user wants to divide it by the weighted average of other rgbs and pixels and finally add them together and display them with the corresponding channels in the second picture.
